                    <p>Our story unfolds in the year 160 of the 2nd age, the age of peace and prosperity for the allied
                        races. Before the creation of the alliance, all races were divided, constantly fighting each
                        other for land and resources on the Mainland until Del’es arrived. Del’es was a hive-mind army
                        from another plane of existence, driven by hunger for power. They managed to submit most of the
                        population of the mainland. The last few surviving colonies created the Council of the World, a
                        council that held a leader from each of the main factions (Humans, Elfs, Dwarfs, Orcs and
                        Tieflings). They managed to unite every last survivor and made a stand against Del’es for 11
                        years, killing thousands if not millions of Del’es army until this evil force retreated back to
                        where it came from. Then the lands of the mainland were split among the races participating in
                        the Council. Peace didn't last long as greedy leaders quickly forgot what brought their
                        ancestors together and they have been plotting against each other in order to gaining more land.
                    </p>
                    <p>There is still a piece of land in the far south not affected by politics. The biggest island of
                        the known world, Menfair, is a place where its occupants mind their own business. The city-state
                        Marin focuses on its own wealth making under the safety provided by the surrounding sea and the
                        strong fleet it possesses. With heavy taxes funding rapid expansions the people started feeling
                        disdain. That’s when Mike Lorak, a young lumberjack, decided he is tired of working tirelessly
                        day and night for a piece of bread. He gathered a handful of skillful people and persuaded them
                        to abandon Marin and start a new village, now known as Bexlay. Our adventurers left their old
                        lives behind and followed Mike to a fresh start. Few but capable, the habitants of Bexlay
                        managed their way for 3 years of living in the wilds, far from the civilization. After hard
                        work, future finally seemed promising.</p>
                    <p>But then the unexpected happened.</p>
